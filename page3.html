<div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The choice for the font Bebes Neue was for its modern look and boldness. We thought this would be captivating when posting on social media with this font especially when used as a header. The other font we used was crimson and this font has a serif style. We loved the contrasting styles of modern and bold to traditional old-school and soft. The crimson font was used in our bodies of texts and made it aesthetically pleasing to read.</span><br></div><div>

The darker shades are to help bring a strong contrast to the warmer tones, so that they can create stronger visuals for our content.

She grew up in Kuala Lumpur, surrounded by urban life and the oppressive humidity. She always had the desire to explore new places. Nadia finished her art study in Malaysia and came across the opportunity to pursue another art study in Breda, the Netherlands.&nbsp;</span><br></li>

This will broaden her artistic understanding and approach as an artist. She also hopes to broaden her perspectives in life, by immersing herself in a new culture. She wants to create a new lifestyle for herself and while also being able to find her community to feel at home. She hopes to expose herself to a new social network, to further her career and personal development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key behaviours&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nadia is very accepting and eager to embrace and interact with new people and their cultures. It is easy to navigate her way around the Netherlands as most people are accepting to Internationals and also speak English to communicate with. Although she is ready to meet new people, she still feels anxious to make the first step. It also becomes difficult with her school schedule and organizing proper plans, which contributes to her hesitations to be social.&nbsp;</li>

New currency, new transportation system, new laws, new climate etc.. The Dutch weather is cold and rainy, completely different from what she is used to in Malaysia, impacting her mood and the way she is used to socializing. The language and building up a social network is her biggest challenge, as she is in a completely new country where she knows nobody and isn’t from the culture. This can cause anxiety, loneliness and also homesickness. Especially since she may feel alienated because she looks or dresses differently than the typical Dutch person. It is difficult to create a social network outside of work/school, considering she knows no one. There is also a big culture shock she experiences, as the Netherlands has a big drinking culture, where most social gatherings center around that, something she is once again not used to. Organizations for expats often only post about big events, parties or festivals. Although excited to be in a new environment, Nadia is still more attracted to small crowds rather than big ones, and likes more intimate ways to socialize, like she used to back home.&nbsp;</li>

She also enjoys unique experiences and exploring various cultures. Taking on this chance to go abroad will allow her to pursue her passion and grow as not only an artist but also a person.&nbsp;</li>

<br>Our brand bridges the gap of being disconnected and homesick by providing information about events, parties, and gatherings on social media so that our target group can attend, with the goal that they can meet new people and build their social network. 
<br>
<br>The main promotional tools used were the social media platforms of Facebook and Instagram. We believe these are the most effective platforms to directly reach our target audience (those between 20 - 35), where we can receive active engagement. These platforms also enhance the awareness of our brand, and also assess the goals we would like to reach for that awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Content Calendar: see appendix</p>

<br>- Hard to stay consistent in posting and aligning content with the content calendar on the feed 
<br>- Plan out the feed better to be more visually stimulating and appealing

<br>- Brand should have engaged further with the audience as a two - way conversation for more active engagement 
<br>
<br>	During the course of this project, we were able to experience what it is like executing a media and communication plan for a brand, and building its social media presence. One of the crucial things we learnt was how drastically different it is posting on a business account in comparison to a personal account. We had to start from scratch, and build up the page, so it was difficult to launch the brand with zero followers. This was a major learning moment, when looking into our media and communication plans objectives, as our expectations were quite high for our engagement, but we soon realized it was not that simple to reach in such a short time. 
<br>
<br>	However, we must say in this short time our Instagram account did grow a lot, with over a hundred followers, and consistency in the likes of each post. We found that reels are the best way to reach large audiences, as some of our reels even reached over 500 accounts. 
<br><br>Facebook was our biggest challenge for achieving interactions. It was harder to build a following there since it isn’t as visually stimulating or engaging as Instagram. Even hashtags weren’t as helpful. Alongside that, our scheduled postings for Facebook were not as coordinated as Instagram, this could have played a factor in the low interactions. It’s also important to note that the posts also weren’t posted exactly on the time it was planned, so we missed that window of opportunity to get exposure during the time our target group was most active, according to our research. In addition, it would’ve been more helpful if we joined expats groups on facebook and posted there as well. 
<br>
<br>In conclusion, it was expected that Instagram would do better as it's easier to boost brand awareness and leverage higher engagement rates on there. We achieved an impressive amount of followers on Instagram and were very pleased with the outcome on that platform, but we hoped Facebook could have gotten more attention. 
<br>
<br> If we could do things differently, it would be to establish a clear message and tone for our brand in the initial stages of launching so we reach the right target audience. Perhaps instead of jumping right into posting events, we should have taken a few posts to discuss homesickness and other facts about belonging, community and acceptance, to further push our values. Another point would be to plan our content in advance, this way we can create scheduled posts and not miss our golden window of opportunity for posting and also stay consistent with our content calendar. In addition, with scheduling and planning our posts, we should have looked into the aesthetics of posting better, so that we could create a more visually stimulating feed for our page. Such as colour coordinating and symmetry. Lastly, we should have been more engaging with our audience by replying to comments, following them back, creating more polls and surveys etc.. By creating this two - way method of communication we could have received even more engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

</em></strong><br>InterNations is one of the competitions we identified. While the concept may be the same with ours, it differs in terms of target audience in which they aim for expats who are over 30 to 45 years old in comparison to our brand which is for 20-35 year olds. In addition, we are more event-based that caters to our target group as a way for them to relax or enjoy events along with connecting with new people. Whereas the InterNations are more informative-based and provide guidance for expats with all concerns. Our main difference is that we aim for genuine connection and community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Xpat.Online is also identified as our competition. Our goals and values line up together surrounding our aim for getting expats to get together through events. The main distinction between our brands is that they provide activities that are Dutch-cultural based. This is their way of easing the expats into the Dutch lifestyle. On the other hand, we focus more on various cultural events for our expats in which they can still enjoy and practice their traditional events from back home. 
<br><br><strong><em>The validation of assumptions</em></strong><br>We know our brand helps expats with their problems, by looking at the engagement on our socials. People can tag their new friends and they will go to the events we recommend.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Three people participated in the website testing. The first two people were BUas students, one of whom was familiar with the project. They had no trouble locating the requested website parts. The only modification we made was changing the name of the second page from "Join the Hub" to "What we do."<br>Our third tester was a middle-aged man in his fifties. He knew nothing about the project or the brand. We discovered that the team section&nbsp;was&nbsp;difficult to locate and that a column should be relocated. Everything else&nbsp;was easy to find in less than a minute. <br>We received positive feedback. Because the web pages&nbsp;are short, all of the information is easily accessible.</p>
